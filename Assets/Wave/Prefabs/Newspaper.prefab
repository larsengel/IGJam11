  m_Text: "We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort
    to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.\n\nTogether,
    we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.\n\nWe
    will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.\n\nEvery
    four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer
    of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama
    for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.\n\nToday\u2019s
    ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring
    power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another \u2013
    but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you,
    the American People.\n\nFor too long, a small group in our nation\u2019s Capital
    has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.\n\nWashington
    flourished \u2013 but the people did not share in its wealth.\n\nPoliticians prospered
    \u2013 but the jobs left, and the factories closed.\n\nThe establishment protected
    itself, but not the citizens of our country.\n\nTheir victories have not been
    your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated
    in our nation\u2019s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families
    all across our land.\n\nThat all changes \u2013 starting right here, and right
    now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.\n\nIt belongs to everyone
    gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. \n\nThis is your
    day. This is your celebration.\n\nAnd this, the United States of America, is your
    country.\n\nWhat truly matters is not which party controls our government, but
    whether our government is controlled by the people.\n\nJanuary 20th 2017, will
    be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. \n\nThe
    forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\n\nEveryone
    is listening to you now.\n\nYou came by the tens of millions to become part of
    a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.\n\nAt
    the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve
    its citizens.\n\nAmericans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods
    for their families, and good jobs for themselves.\n\nThese are the just and reasonable
    demands of a righteous public.\n\nBut for too many of our citizens, a different
    reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out
    factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education
    system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived
    of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives
    and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\n\nThis American carnage
    stops right here and stops right now.\n\nWe are one nation \u2013 and their pain
    is our pain.  Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success.
    \ We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.\n\nThe oath of office
    I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.\n\nFor many decades, we\u2019ve
    enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;\n\nSubsidized the
    armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;\n\nWe've
    defended other nation\u2019s borders while refusing to defend our own;\n\nAnd
    spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen
    into disrepair and decay.\n\nWe\u2019ve made other countries rich while the wealth,
    strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.\n\nOne
    by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about
    the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.\n\nThe wealth of our
    middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the
    entire world.\n\nBut that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.\n\nWe
    assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every
    foreign capital, and in every hall of power.\n\nFrom this day forward, a new vision
    will govern our land.\n\nFrom this moment on, it\u2019s going to be America First.\n\nEvery
    decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made
    to benefit American workers and American families.\n\nWe must protect our borders
    from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies,
    and destroying our jobs.  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.\n\nI
    will fight for you with every breath in my body \u2013 and I will never, ever
    let you down.\n\nAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before.\n\nWe
    will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders.  We will bring back
    our wealth.  And we will bring back our dreams.\n\nWe will build new roads, and
    highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our
    wonderful nation.\n\nWe will get our people off of welfare and back to work \u2013
    rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.\n\nWe will follow
    two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.\n\nWe will seek friendship and
    goodwill with the nations of the world \u2013 but we do so with the understanding
    that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\n\nWe do
    not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an
    example for everyone to follow.\n\nWe will reinforce old alliances and form new
    ones \u2013 and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which
    we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.\n\nAt the bedrock of
    our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through
    our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.\n\nWhen
    you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.\n\nThe Bible
    tells us, \u201Chow good and pleasant it is when God\u2019s people live together
    in unity.\u201D\n\nWe must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly,
    but always pursue solidarity.\n\nWhen America is united, America is totally unstoppable.\n\nThere
    should be no fear \u2013 we are protected, and we will always be protected.\n\nWe
    will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement
    and, most importantly, we are protected by God.\n\nFinally, we must think big
    and dream even bigger.\n\nIn America, we understand that a nation is only living
    as long as it is striving.\n\nWe will no longer accept politicians who are all
    talk and no action \u2013 constantly complaining but never doing anything about
    it.\n\nThe time for empty talk is over.\n\nNow arrives the hour of action.\n\nDo
    not let anyone tell you it cannot be done.  No challenge can match the heart and
    fight and spirit of America.\n\nWe will not fail. Our country will thrive and
    prosper again.\n\nWe stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the
    mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness
    the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.\n\nA new national pride
    will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.\n\nIt is time to
    remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black
    or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the
    same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.\n\nAnd
    whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains
    of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the
    same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty
    Creator.\n\nSo to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large,
    from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:\n\nYou will
    never be ignored again.\n\nYour voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define
    our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide
    us along the way.\n\nTogether, We Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make
    America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\n\nWe Will Make America
    Safe Again.\n\nAnd, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you,
    God Bless You, And God Bless America."

    your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated
    in our nation\u2019s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families
    all across our land.\n\nThat all changes \u2013 starting right here, and right
    now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.\n\nIt belongs to everyone
    gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. \n\nThis is your
    day. This is your celebration.\n\nAnd this, the United States of America, is your
    country.\n\nWhat truly matters is not which party controls our government, but
    whether our government is controlled by the people.\n\nJanuary 20th 2017, will
    be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. \n\nThe
    forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\n\nEveryone
    is listening to you now.\n\nYou came by the tens of millions to become part of
    a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.\n\nAt
    the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve
    its citizens.\n\nAmericans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods
    for their families, and good jobs for themselves.\n\nThese are the just and reasonable
    demands of a righteous public.\n\nBut for too many of our citizens, a different
    reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out
    factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education
    system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived
    of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives
    and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\n\nThis American carnage
    stops right here and stops right now.\n\nWe are one nation \u2013 and their pain
    is our pain.  Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success.
    \ We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.\n\nThe oath of office
    I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.\n\nFor many decades, we\u2019ve
    enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;\n\nSubsidized the
    armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;\n\nWe've
    defended other nation\u2019s borders while refusing to defend our own;\n\nAnd
    spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen
    into disrepair and decay.\n\nWe\u2019ve made other countries rich while the wealth,
    strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.\n\nOne
    by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about
    the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.\n\nThe wealth of our
    middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the
    entire world.\n\nBut that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.\n\nWe
    assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every
    foreign capital, and in every hall of power.\n\nFrom this day forward, a new vision
    will govern our land.\n\nFrom this moment on, it\u2019s going to be America First.\n\nEvery
    decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made
    to benefit American workers and American families.\n\nWe must protect our borders
    from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies,
    and destroying our jobs.  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.\n\nI
    will fight for you with every breath in my body \u2013 and I will never, ever
    let you down.\n\nAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before.\n\nWe
    will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders.  We will bring back
    our wealth.  And we will bring back our dreams.\n\nWe will build new roads, and
    highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our
    wonderful nation.\n\nWe will get our people off of welfare and back to work \u2013
    rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.\n\nWe will follow
    two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.\n\nWe will seek friendship and
    goodwill with the nations of the world \u2013 but we do so with the understanding
    that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\n\nWe do
    not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an
    example for everyone to follow.\n\nWe will reinforce old alliances and form new
    ones \u2013 and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which
    we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.\n\nAt the bedrock of
    our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through
    our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.\n\nWhen
    you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.\n\nThe Bible
    tells us, \u201Chow good and pleasant it is when God\u2019s people live together
    in unity.\u201D\n\nWe must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly,
    but always pursue solidarity.\n\nWhen America is united, America is totally unstoppable.\n\nThere
    should be no fear \u2013 we are protected, and we will always be protected.\n\nWe
    will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement
    and, most importantly, we are protected by God.\n\nFinally, we must think big
    and dream even bigger.\n\nIn America, we understand that a nation is only living
    as long as it is striving.\n\nWe will no longer accept politicians who are all
    talk and no action \u2013 constantly complaining but never doing anything about
    it.\n\nThe time for empty talk is over.\n\nNow arrives the hour of action.\n\nDo
    not let anyone tell you it cannot be done.  No challenge can match the heart and
    fight and spirit of America.\n\nWe will not fail. Our country will thrive and
    prosper again.\n\nWe stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the
    mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness
    the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.\n\nA new national pride
    will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.\n\nIt is time to
    remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black
    or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the
    same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.\n\nAnd
    whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains
    of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the
    same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty
    Creator.\n\nSo to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large,
    from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:\n\nYou will
    never be ignored again.\n\nYour voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define
    our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide
    us along the way.\n\nTogether, We Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make
    America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\n\nWe Will Make America
    Safe Again.\n\nAnd, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you,
    God Bless You, And God Bless America."
